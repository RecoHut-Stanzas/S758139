        "| Problem | Group recommendation problem is challenging because recommending some item that satisfies all the members of the group is rare. So it often involves some compromises that the model has to make in order to maximize the overall satisfaction of the group. |\n",
        "| Hypothesis | RL agent can learn the required behavior that could the maximize the group's overall satisfaction. |\n",
        "| Benefits | Meaningful to those people who want to get recommendations for their groups, such as entertainments with families and travels with friends. This model consider the influences of each group member by one self-attention mechanism. |\n",
        "| Solution | A recommender agent is trained with actor-critic network and is optimized with DDPG algorithm, where the experience replay and target networks are used. Matrix factorization based simulator is built to simulate the MDP environment. It is an extended version of LIRD model for group recommendations. The group recommendation is viewed as a classification task. When one item is recommended to a group, if the group chooses the item, this case is marked as a positive sample. Otherwise, it will be a negative sample. |\n",
        "| Dataset | MovieLens-1m |\n",
        "| Preprocessing | Randomly generate groups with 2-5 users. Then, for each group, if every member gives 4-5 stars to one movie, we assume that this movie is adopted by this group with rating 1. If all members give ratings to one movie, but not all in 4-5 stars, we consider the group gives rating 0 to this movie. For other cases, the group movie ratings are missed. Finally, to ensure each group has enough interactions with items, we require each group has at least 20 ratings. Also, for each rating, 100 rating-missed items are randomly sampled. Both user and group rating data are split into training, validation, and testing datasets with the ratio of 70%, 10%, and 20% respectively by the temporal order. |\n",

        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The recommender system is viewed as an agent, which interacts with the environment $\\mathcal{E}$ by recommending items to maximize its reward. The environment is a set of multiple groups, where one single user is assumed to be one member group here. This task is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Formally, this MDP contains five elements $\\mathcal{(S, A, P, R,\\gamma)}$ as follows. Let $\\mathcal{U}$, $\\mathcal{G}$, and $\\mathcal{I}$ be sets of user, group, and item ids respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "- State space $\\mathcal{S}$: A state $𝑠_𝑡 \\in \\mathcal{S}$ represents the state of a group at time 𝑡. A state $𝑠_𝑡 = [𝑔, ℎ_𝑡]$ consists of two parts, one for the group id 𝑔 ∈ G and another for the group browsing history $ℎ_𝑡$. The group id 𝑔 can be mapped to its members, i.e. 𝑔 = {𝑢1, 𝑢2, . . . }, where 𝑢1, 𝑢2, · · · ∈ U. The browsing history of a group is ℎ𝑡 = [𝑖1,𝑖2, . . . ,𝑖𝑁 ], where 𝑖1,𝑖2, . . . ,𝑖𝑁 ∈ $\\mathcal{I}$.\n",
        "- Action space $\\mathcal{A}$: An action 𝑎𝑡 = [𝑖𝑡,1,𝑖𝑡,2, . . . ,𝑖𝑡,𝐾] ∈ $\\mathcal{A}$ is a list of items recommended to a group from the recommender system, where 𝐾 is the number of items. For learning efficiency, we will use 𝐾 = 1 when the agent interacts with the environment, i.e. 𝑎𝑡 ∈ $\\mathcal{I}$.\n",
        "- Reward $\\mathcal{R}$: After an action 𝑎𝑡 is taken by the recommender to a group at one state 𝑠𝑡, the recommender will receive a reward 𝑟𝑡 ∈ {0, 1} based on the group response. The reward will be 𝑟𝑡 = 1, if the recommended item is picked by this group. Otherwise, 𝑟𝑡 = 0.\n",
        "- Transition probability $\\mathcal{P}$: Transition probability is defined as $𝑝(𝑠_{𝑡+1} |𝑠_𝑡,𝑎_𝑡)$, which satisfies the Markov property. This probability measures how the environment evolve with the time 𝑡.\n",
        "- Discount factor 𝛾: The 𝛾 ∈ [0, 1] measures how the future reward will be valuated today.\n",
        "\n",
        "By given this MDP $\\mathcal{(S, A, P, R,\\gamma)}$, the agent will try to maximize its rewards by taking actions to interact with the environment. The solution will be the policy 𝜋 : $\\mathcal{S}$ → $\\mathcal{A}$.\n",

The group id 𝑔 is mapped to its group members  $𝑔 = \\{𝑢_1, 𝑢_2, \\dots\\}$ first, then those user ids are embedded through the user embedding layer to $\\{u_1, u_2, \\dots\\}$.

To promote exploration, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process noise can be added here. This action weight will take inner products with item embeddings, i.e. $𝑠_𝑗 = w_𝑡^T i_𝑗$. The item with the highest $𝑠_𝑗$ will be recommended to the group, and the corresponding item embedding will be sent to the critic next. The actor network can be optimized by the policy gradient.\n",

        "Both bandit algorithms and A/B tests are online algorithms, which means that they do not have a full set of data upfront to be trained on. Instead, they learn incrementally as the data is accrued. Their performance can be evaluated offline, however, through backtesting using a technique known as the “replay” method. This works by predicting which option the algorithm would select for a viewer, and if there is a historical record of the viewer’s interaction with that option, the result — whether the experience was positive or negative — is counted as if it had happened. If there is no historical record of that interaction, it is ignored.\n",
